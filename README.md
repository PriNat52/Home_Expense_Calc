  The Python program focuses on three main features. They are savings calculation from income/expenses, retirement calculation and updating the retirement calculation to the text file.
   
   For the savings calculation, the input from the user can be given in four different ways such as weekly, bi-weekly, monthly and semi-monthly.  This feature is useful to all user depending on their type of paycheck. Then the expenses are given by the user which is later calculated and the output for total amount spent, amount saved per month and saved per year are displayed.

  For the retirement calculation the user provides few mandatory information such as current savings for name, retirement, current age, retirement age, yearly contribution and average annual return. Which is then calculated and displays the output with user name, number of years and the calculated retirement amount.

  The calculated retirement amount with number of years updates into a text file. This feature is useful because the information can be accessed anytime by the user, instead of calculating every time the user needs it. The records in the output file are saved with name, date and time which helps the user to identify the record easily. Then the program is designed in such a way that, only if the user wants to see all the saved information in the output file it displays them or else it can be skipped.
